# Hurricane Analysis Project

## Overview
This project is centered on analyzing hurricane data and exposure data, with a focus on data integration, exploratory data analysis, visualization, and predictive modeling. The project is divided into several checkpoints, each with specific goals and deliverables.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into four major parts, each with its own set of objectives and tasks.

## Data Preparation
  - Import and clean data from `hurricane.csv` and `exposures.csv`.
  - Merge datasets using data manipulation techniques.
  - Conduct basic exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends and patterns.
  - Present initial visualizations (histograms, scatter plots) in Jupyter or VS Code.

## Visualization
  - Develop a geographical map to understand the data's geographical patterns.
  - Perform feature engineering, creating variables like distance to hurricane eye, average wind/pressure.
  - Normalize and split the dataset for machine learning model implementation.
  - Display before-and-after tables and code snippets showcasing the feature engineering process and initial model training steps.

## Modeling Process
  - Continue training models for hurricane classifier and forecasting and exposure insured value prediction (Classification, Regression, Clustering, Random Forest, time series).
  - Validate models using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error, F1-score.
  - Present model performance through training curves, confusion matrices, and comparative metrics.
  - Begin Dash/Plotly Dashboard or Flask web app development for presenting initial visualizations.

## Dashboard Development
  - Refine and retrain models based on previous feedback, presenting updated metrics and training curves.
  - Complete and update the Dash/Plotly Dashboard with model results.
  - Conduct a demo to navigate through the updated Dash application, highlighting new features and including more comprehensive model summaries.
